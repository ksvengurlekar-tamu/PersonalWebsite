            <h2>Experience and Skills</h2>

            <p>
                My skills include programming in languages like Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript.
                These are used in 
                <a href="https://catalog.tamu.edu/undergraduate/engineering/computer-science/bs/#programrequirementstext">coursework</a> 
                areas such as data structures, algorithms, operating system design, and computer architecture. 
                Through coursework, I studied the hardware components of processors and internal machine-level 
                processes when running programs. I am proficient in X-86 assembly instructions because it was 
                required to learn how compilation occurs internally with the whole system architecture. Through 
                my operating system course, I studied Linux/Unix commands and functionality when interacting 
                with running processes. This includes concurrency, parallelism, and data pipes. I am also 
                proficient in front-end development software such as Angular.JS and Node.JS. I am experienced 
                with using HMTL and CSS formatting to build web pages. I am pursuing a minor concurrent to my 
                bachelor's degree in math. My coursework for this minor includes Calculus I, II, and III, 
                Linear Algebra, Discrete Math, and Differential Equations.

            <h2>Why Computer Science?</h2>
            <p>
                I chose the Computer Science career path because both of my parents and even my grandfather 
                pursued careers in tech. I grew up learning to think logically and technically like they did. 
                When I first began taking courses in math and programming, it came naturally to me. The 
                assignments I was given felt like puzzles, and I was able to think through them fluidly. 
                Now that I am older, I can apply the human aspect to the work I've been doing in school. 
                I am starting to understand the impact and the reason behind the demand for new developments. 
                I am so fascinated by how a few seconds of algorithmic run time are worth millions of dollars 
                to companies trying to optimize their products. I can clearly visualize how the newest 
                technological advancements impact everyone's day-to-day. I want to follow in the footsteps 
                of my parents and grandpa and be a part of the process that changes the world.

            <h2>Area of Interest</h2>
            <p>
                I hope to specialize my career in data science and machine learning. I have acknowledged 
                the trend of technologies collecting tremendous amounts of data and using machine learning 
                technologies to provide their services. I can tell that this industry has the most 
                potential in it. I personally want to be a pioneer in this industry with something 
                creative, innovative, and essential for society in the future.
