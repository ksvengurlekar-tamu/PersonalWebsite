            <p>
                My skills include programming in languages like Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript.
                I use these in <a href="https://catalog.tamu.edu/undergraduate/engineering/computer-science/bs/#programrequirementstext">
                coursework</a> such as Data Structures, Algorithms, Operating System
                Design, and Computer Architecture. I am also proficient in front end development 
                software such as Angular.JS and Node.JS. I am experienced with using HMTL and CSS 
                formatting to build web pages. I am pursuing a minor concurrent to my Bachelor's
                degree in Math. My coursework includes, Calculus I, II, and III, Linear Algebra,
                Discrete Math, and Differential Equations.

            <h2>Why Computer Science?</h2>
            <p>
                I chose the Computer Science career path because both of my parents, and even my
                grandfather, pursued careers in tech. I grew up learning to think logically and
                technically like they did. When I first began taking courses in math and programming,
                it came naturally to me. Now that I am older, I can apply the human aspect to the
                work I've been doing in school. I am starting to understand the impact and the
                reason behind the demand for new developments. I am so facinated by how a few seconds 
                of algorithmic run time are worth millions of dollars from companies trying to
                optimize their products. I want to take after my parents and grandpa and be a part
                of the process that changes the world.
