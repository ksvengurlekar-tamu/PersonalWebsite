            <p>
                Throughout high school, I participated in a service outreach organization called the
                <a href="https://ymsl.org/">Young Men's Service League</a>. I held the role of president of that organization,
                while simultaneously doing 150 hours of service. I volunteered with organizations
                such as Rainbow Days, The Dallas Ramp Project, Spokes for Folks, and Feed my Starving
                Children. Pictured here is me after a food packing session for Feed my Starving Children.
                In college, I participated in a leadership organization called <a href="https://www.aggieflash.com/">
                Leaders Advancing in Service and Honor</a>. This organization held service events and 
                donation drives for the local communnity and philanthropies such as Twin City
                Missions.

            <h2>Fish Camp Counselor</h2>
            <img src="resources/camp_counselor.PNG" class="right_image">
            <p>
                I participated in one of Texas A&M's first tradition: <a href="https://fishcamp.tamu.edu/">Fish Camp</a>. I was a counselor
                for fifteen incoming freshmen during the time of camp and continued to be a mentor
                throughout their first year on their own in college. The main focus of camp is to 
                accustom the freshmen to life on
                campus and demonstrate what it means to be an Aggie at Texas A&M. During camp, I led group
                discussions, conducted bonding activities, and gave guidance about the social norms of
                college life at A&M.  While working 
                with a team of thirty other counselors, I hosted
                and delegated a group of 150 incoming freshmen over the course of the camp.
