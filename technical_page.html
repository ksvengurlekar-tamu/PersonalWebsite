            <p>
                For this project, I and four other team members created our own 
                <a href="https://cse.unl.edu/~goddard/Courses/CSCE230J/Lectures/Lecture10.pdf">Y-86 processor circuit. </a>
                The processor implemented all five stages of instruction pipelining and was fully 
                functional when computing basic instructions like insertion sort or matrix multiplication. 
                The circuit showed a fully functional ROM, RAM, and memory system. Each stage of instruction 
                pipelining has its own individual component. I personally implemented the fetch, program 
                counter, and ALU components, along with integrating the processes together to ensure
                pipeline capabilities. The digital circuit design platform we used was

            <h2>TAMU Hackathon ASL Translator</h2>
            <img src="./resources/CSCE-news-TAMUhack-25Feb2020.jpg" alt="Image" class="left_image">
            <p>
                The <a href="https://tamudatathon.com/">Texas A&M Hackathon </a>is a recruiting 
                competition where various companies provide open-ended problems to solve. With the
                help of three colleagues, I chose the prompt, which said to implement a solution to 
                help a group with a social disability. The solution we came up with was to make a translator 
                for American Sign Language (ASL). We used Python's speech-to-text package and the online 
                English Lexicon to display corresponding ASL signs based on user audio input. The output 
                would display 90% of English words translated into ASL, and if the word was not found in 
                the database of words, it would be spelled out using alphabetical signs.
