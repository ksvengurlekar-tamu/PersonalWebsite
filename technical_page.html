            <p>
                For this project, I, and four other team members, created our own 
                <a href="https://cse.unl.edu/~goddard/Courses/CSCE230J/Lectures/Lecture10.pdf">
                Y-86 processor</a>
                circuit. The processor implemented all five stages of instruction pipelining
                and was fully function when computing basic instructions like insertion sort or
                matrix multiplication. The circuit showed a fully functional ROM, RAM, and memory
                system. Each stage of instruction pipelining has its own individual
                commoponent. I personly implemented the Fetch, Program Counter, and ALU components,
                along with integrating the processes together to ensure pipeline capabilities. The 
                digital circuit designing platform we used was <a href="https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution">Logism-Evolution.</a>

            <h2>TAMU Hackathon ASL translator</h2>
            <img src="./resources/CSCE-news-TAMUhack-25Feb2020.jpg" alt="Image" class="left_image">
            <p>
                <a href="https://tamudatathon.com/"> Texas A&M Hackathon</a> is a recruiting competition where various companies provide
                open-ended problems to solve. With the help of three colleagues, I chose the prompt
                which said to implement a solution to help a group with a social disability. The
                solution we came up with was to make a translator for American Sign Language (ASL).
                We used Python's speech-to-text package and the online English Lexicon to display
                corresponding ASL signs based on user audio input. The output would display 90% of 
                English words translated into ASL, and if the word was not found in the database
                of words, it would be spelled out using alphabetical signs.
